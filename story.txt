Sally loves animals so she decided to go to the pet store to adopt a kitten. However, after spending 2 hours in the store, she came out with something crazy!

She came out with a lion cub! The store was trying hard to find someone to adopt the cub, but nobody wanted to go through the hassle of getting a government permit to handle it. Sally, however, knew she had to adopt it after seeing how cute it was, no matter how hard the paperwork would be.
