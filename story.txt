Sally loves animals so she decided to go to the pet store to adopt a kitten. However, after spending 2 hours in the store,
she came out with something crazy!

She came out with a lion cub! The store was trying hard to find someone to adopt the cub, but nobody wanted to go through
the hassle of getting a government permit to handle it. 
Sally, however, knew she had to adopt it after seeing how cute it was, no matter how hard the paperwork would be. 
All it would take is a visit to the nearby verification center. 

She walks into the verification center, which was right next to the pet store, and began to fill out the "Adopting a Lion" 
packet on the counter. 4 hours later, she had her permit and walked back to the store.

Sally was beaming, and strutted into the pet store with the permit in her hand. The pet store owners were puzzled to see a 
9 year old get the permit from the verification center with no adult supervision, but they were happy to finally
have someone wiling to adopt the lion cub. As she walked back home with the little cub in her hands she was stopped by 
someone unexpected.
